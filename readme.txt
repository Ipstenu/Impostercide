Prevent unauthenticated users from using a registered users' credentials when commenting.

== Description ==

Impostercide prevents unauthenticated users from "signing" a comment with a registered users email address or username.  You can install this, turn it on, and watch the spoofers get stopped.

If needed, you can customize the error messages. For WordPress multisite, this is only editable by the Network admin, and it's for the whole network.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this work on older versions of WordPress? =

This will work on WordPress from version 2.1 and up, however it's no longer supported on anything before 5.7 due to changes in data structure.

= How do I change the message that displays? =

Go to the TOOLS menu and click on 'Impostercide'. There you can customize the message.

= Will this work on MultiSite? =

Yes, but only the network admin can change the messages, and they control it for the whole network.

= Can this catch innocents? =

Any tool can, however it requires a person with an account to forget they have an account.
