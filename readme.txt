== Description ==

Impostercide prevents unauthenticated users from "signing" a comment with a registered users email address or username.  You can install this, turn it on, and watch the spoofers get stopped.

If needed, you can customize the error messages. For WordPress multisite, this is only editable by the Network admin, and it's for the whole network.
