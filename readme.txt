== Description ==

Impostercide prevents unauthenticated users from "signing" a comment with a registered users email address or username.  There is no interface from the admin's end, no options to select.  Simply install, turn it on, and watch the spoofers get stopped.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this work on older versions of WordPress? =

This will work on WordPress from version 2.1 and up.

= Will this work on MultiSite? =

Again, yes.  I suggest putting it in `mu-plugins`, but it works fine both ways.

= Can this catch innocents? =

Yes, but ... well. The only person I've caught is someone who is, apparently, pathalogically incapable of remembering that he HAS an account on the site, and he needs to LOG IN with said account. He also claims to forget his password and that WordPress doesn't email it to him, so I'm pretty much chucking his complaint as a problem with the user, and not the tool.

== Screenshots ==
